### Campus Management System ðŸŽ“
The Campus Management System is a web application built with Laravel, Vue, PHP, and Blade, designed to simplify and manage campus operations. This system provides separate portals for admins and students, allowing administrators to manage subjects, attendance, and other academic details, while students can view their own progress and access limited campus information.
